<h4><a href="https://www.conservation.org/Pages/default.aspx">CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL</a></h4>
Conservation International combines science, policy and fieldwork to help communities, countries and societies protect the Earth’s ecosystems. It mainly focuses on deforestation and global warming, working with communities, governments and partner organizations through a combination of policy, fieldwork and science in order to tackle deforestation. Every person on Earth deserves a healthy environment and the fundamental benefits that nature provides. But our planet is experiencing an unprecedented drawdown of these resources, and it is only by protecting nature and its gifts – a stable climate, fresh water, healthy oceans and reliable food – that we can ensure a better life for everyone, everywhere.
