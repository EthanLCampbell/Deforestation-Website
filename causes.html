        <p> <h3 style = "color:lightblue">Logging</h3>Illegal logging activities are very common that destroy the livelihoods of the people depending on forests. Wood-based industries like paper, match-sticks, furniture need a substantial amount of wood supply. Wood is used as fuel most commonly and so large amount of trees are cut down for fuel supplies. Firewood and charcoal are used as fuel.<br>

        <h3 style = "color:lightblue">Agriculture</h3>The conversion of forests into agricultural land is a big reason for deforestation. Due to overgrowing demand for food products, many trees are chopped down for crops and for cattle grazing. Over 40% of the forests are cleaned to obtain land and meet the needs of agriculture and wood.<br>
        
        <h3 style = "color:lightblue">Mining</h3>
        Oil and mining of coal require a large amount of forest land. Construction of roads leads to deforestation as they provide the way to remote land. The waste that comes out from mining pollutes the environment and affects the nearby species.<br>
        
        <h3 style = "color:lightblue">Urbanization</h3>
        As the population grows, the needs of people increases which further leads to deforestation. Forests shrink to a great extent to meet the requirements like for construction of roads, development of houses, mineral exploitation and expansion of industries. Increasing population directly affects forest as with the expansion of cities there is a need for more land for housing and settlements.<br>
        
        <h3 style = "color:lightblue"> Timber Production </h3>
        One of the primary cause of deforestation is the production of timber. There is a lot of demand for timber and so deforestation increases. It a source of raw material which is used for the production of paper and also for construction.
